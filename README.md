***Write out pseudo-code first! You'll be coding your solution in `grandma.rb`.***

Write a `speak_to_grandma` method that accepts one argument: what you want to say to her. Whatever you say to grandma (whatever
you type in), she should respond with `HUH?!  SPEAK UP, SONNY!`, unless you shout it (type in all capitals). If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so) and yells back, `NO, NOT SINCE 1938!`.

Need help figuring out how to use if/else statements? Check out the resources below.

### BONUS
Too easy? To make your program really believable, have grandma shout a different year each time you run the program; maybe any year at random between 1930 and 1950. (Hint: There is a Ruby method that will generate random numbers.) 

### BONUS #2
Still too easy? To make your grandma method even more realistic, use one of the things that grandmas always say. Randomly generate a statement from the list found on this [website](https://www.grandmasbriefs.com/home/25-things-grandmas-supposedly-say-that-ive-never-heard-fellow-grandmothers-utter)! All of the sayings can be found in the `grandma-sayings.rb` file.

### DOUBLE BONUS
Grandma decided she wants to keep talking to you and won't let you leave. Change your program so that it keeps running until you shout BYE. (Hint: You will probably want to use a `while loop` to keep the program running.)

### TRIPLE BONUS
Grandma really doesn't want you to leave! When you shout BYE, she pretends not to hear you. Change your program so that you have to shout BYE three times in a row before the program will end. Make sure to test your program: if you shout BYE three times, but not in a row, you should still be talking to grandma.
